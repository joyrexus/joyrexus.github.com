## Summary

My professional focus for the past ten years has centered on data curation and custom tooling for medium-scale research projects in the social sciences.  I consider myself a “full-stack” developer, dangerous at many levels, expert in none.  

I'm particularly adept at inferring the needs of non-technical researchers as well as working with such users in formulating realistic project outcomes.


## Current

I've been working as a research programmer and data maintainer for the
University of Chicago since 2003.  I've served in this role under the aegis of
a variety of grant funded projects, primarily the [Language Development
Project](https://ldp.uchicago.edu/) and the [Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center](http://spatiallearning.org/).

The responsibilities I've assumed in this role run the gamut from maintaing
rsync backups of our various servers to assisting with statistical analyses of
new research findings. I'm responsible for ...

* the development of [technical documentation](http://joyrexus.spc.uchicago.edu/ldp/docs/)
* administering our internal revision control system
* setup and administration of our main [systems and servers](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/a36841ec62593bc4a3d9)
* development and maintenance of the LDP's [main corpus and research
  dataset](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/97371bcb93ab7b7a5958)
* development of a [python-based API and library of utilities](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp/tree/master/code/lib/python) for [querying](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp/blob/master/reports/cassie/2014-02-21/query.py) and analyzing the LDP's main corpus and research dataset
* the documenting and regression testing of all library modules (see example [module](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp/blob/master/code/lib/python/ldp/grammar/match/utterance.py) and [test suite](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp/blob/master/code/lib/python/ldp/grammar/match/tests/phrase_test.py))
* generating [custom reports](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp/tree/master/reports) for researchers with complex query requests
* directing database and web development for internal projects

I oversaw, mentored, and directed the work of a number of technical staff members,
including [our web developer and DBA](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bentrofatter), now at Google.  I've provided technical guidance and mentoring to dozens of post-docs and graduate students: basic unix-command line skills (sed, awk, or perl one-liners), revision control essentials, and perl and python scripting idioms. Over time I built up [a set of quick reference notes](http://joyrexus.spc.uchicago.edu/labs/notes/index.html#tools) for internal use based on the informal instruction I was providing. 

I also directed a [technical internship](https://github.com/joyrexus/intern/blob/master/notes.md) on behalf of the Goldin-Meadow Lab for the Laboratory School's [Summer Link](http://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/schools/high-school/summerlink/index.aspx) program over the summer 2013 session.  The focus was on literate scripting and algorithmic visualization.  My [intern](http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/gamechanger/portfolios/walker-melton/)'s [final project](https://github.com/wmelton12/PhysSims) was to develop a simulation of a bouncing ball that reacted in response to user-specified input.

More recently, I've developed a number of simple [touch-enabled web apps](https://github.com/joyrexus/silc/tree/master/tasks/rotation) for the SILC group.  These iPad-deployed pilot projects are designed to assess spatial abilities. 

Much of the work I've done for the LDP is currently archived [here](https://github.com/joyrexus/ldp).  More recent work for SILC is perusable [here](https://github.com/joyrexus/silc).  However, I'm planning on migrating these archives and all future work on these projects to dedicated repos under their respective organization accounts, viz. [ldp-uchicago](https://github.com/ldp-uchicago) and [silc-uchicago](https://github.com/silc-uchicago).

I've most recently been working with a post-doc on a [research study](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/8461988#research-study-description) that utilizes the Leap Motion sensor for analyzing the substructure of certain hand gestures.  For this project I've developed a set of utilities for [recording](https://github.com/joyrexus/leap-record) and [viewing](https://github.com/joyrexus/leap-view) gesture samples.  I'm currently developing selection, filtering, and extraction tools for the gesture sample viewer.

My position with the LDC & SILC has given me the opportunity to work closely with a number of leading faculty members in the social sciences (including Susan Golin-Meadow, Susan Levine, Janellen Huttenlocher, Stephen Raudenbush, Larry Hedges, and Dana Suskind).  I've also had the pleasure of working with dozens of extremely talented graduate students and post-docs on a variety of research projects based on the longitudinal data I curate for the LDP.


## Past

I did my undergraduate studies (1991-95) at [St. John's College](http://www.sjca.edu/), Annapolis, MD, obtaining a B.A. in Liberal Arts.

After graduating from St. John's, I worked for a tech startup, Kenan Systems (now [Comverse](http://www.kenan.com/)), founded by an [MIT academic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenan_Sahin). The company was based in Cambridge, MA, specializing in highly flexible billing, order processing, and customer analysis software for large communication carriers, such as France Telecom.  

I worked for Kenan/Lucent from 1997 to 2000, initially as a network support engineer (97-98), then as a unix systems administrator (98-99), and finally as the coordinator/sys-admin of our Demo and Integration Lab (99-00).  The Demo Lab provided a "hands-on" showcase for our core systems interacting with best-of-breed networking hardware supplied by Lucent.  It also served a critical role as a "live" integration testbed for new projects. For example, new VoIP solutions (enabling tiered quality-of-service) developed at Bell Labs (Lucent's R&D division) could be tested with our order provisioning system.

After leaving Lucent, I took lengthy sabbatical to do some traveling and to
work as an [apprentice boatbuilder](https://www.facebook.com/CarpentersBoatshop) in Pemaquid, Maine (2001-2).


## Other

I have a number of little [open source projects](https://github.com/joyrexus) perusable on github.

I frequently generate [gists](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus) to demonstrate or document some useful [method](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/7360353), [technique](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus/6956598), or [pattern](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/9007874).

I began work on a [Computer Science Masters](http://csmasters.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago in 2009 but quickly became disillusioned with the cost to quality-of-instruction ratio.  I've since attempted to further my analytical skill set by working through freely available courseware on Udacity and Coursera.  My favorite online course to date has been Peter Norvig's [CS212](https://github.com/joyrexus/CS212), which I completed with [high distinction](https://github.com/joyrexus/CS212/blob/master/certificate.pdf?raw=true).

As a sys admin, I've written a great many perl scripts. I've done some work
with C, Java, and R in a professional capacity.  For personal projects, I've
enjoyed working with Ruby, ML, and especially Scheme.  However, I've done most of my professional development work in Python.

My current language of choice is currently [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), esp. in [literate](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) form.

I'm especially enamored of the [vibrant](http://caines.ca/blog/programming/the-node-js-community-is-quietly-changing-the-face-of-open-source/) [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) [ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.org/) and try to make small contributions to the community when possible.  (One of my [current projects](https://github.com/joyrexus/func-js-book) is to convert all of the source code examples from the book [Functional Javascript](http://www.functionaljavascript.com/) into functional coffeescript.)
