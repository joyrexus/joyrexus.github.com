# Experience

## *Lucent Technologies*, Software Products Group, Cambridge, MA

**iCARE Project Coordinator** (Jun ‘99 – Nov ‘00)

iCARE was a fast-track development initiative within Kenan/Lucent, designed to provide a highly customizable web-based interface to the Arbor/BP billing system for customer self-care, account management, and service provisioning. The system was based on HP/Bluestone’s J2EE-compliant & XML- based Application Servers and Borland’s VisiBroker CORBA middleware. As Project Coordinator for an emergent development team I assumed a variety of responsibilities, including:

* Partner management and licensing agreements with HP/Bluestone and Borland (Most notably,I helped develop a formal partnership — “strategic alliance” — and key software licensing agreements with both companies)
* Internal demos, documentation, training, and support
* First-phase testing and deployment at beta sites
* Coordinating product rollout efforts with Kenan/Lucent’s Q/A, Documentation,Training, Support, Consulting, Pre-Sales, Sales, Marketing, and Legal Groups
* Technical assessment andbenchmarkingofnewtechnologyplatforms,standards,andprotocols
for related project initiatives, such as: J2EE/XML Application Servers & CORBA middleware frameworks to serve as a basis for the iCARE system; policy-based intelligent networking via the DMTF DEN (Directory-enabled Networks) schema; technology solutions for VOIP, EBPP (Electronic Bill Presentment & Payment), IP metering and mediation, and usage-based billing.

**Kenan.net SysAdmin & Coordinator** (Dec ‘98 – Jun ‘99)

Kenan.net was Kenan/Lucent’s Cambridge-based demo and integration lab. We worked closely with Bell Labs’ Network Application Group & Networking Research Lab. I was the lead in the lab’s design, deployment, and day-to-day administration.The lab served as (1) a fully-functional dial-up ISP POP for employees of the Cambridge office, providing free dial-up web access, mail, FTP, and Telnet services; (2) a demonstration center showcasing Kenan/Lucent’s billing and customer-care solutions in a fully operational environment comprised of advanced Lucent networking equipment; (3) a testbed for integrating and troubleshooting new hardware and software solutions under development, such as Kenan/Bell Labs’ prototype IP Mediation system and Kenan’s iCARE web-based customer self-care solution. In addition to multiple back-end servers running the communication services, billing, and other software, the lab was comprised of the following network elements:

* Cisco Router | CSU/DSU (provided with our leased lines, but eventually replaced by our own MAX TNT Universal Gateway as our channelized T1/E1 access point)
* Lucent NavisRadius AAA Server
* Lucent VPN Firewall Brick
* Lucent LDAP Directory Server
* Lucent NetCounter (Bell Labs prototype, a special-purpose network probe for capturing user-and service-specific metrics on IP networks)


## Kenan Systems Corp., Technical Infrastructure Group, Cambridge, MA

**Interim Unix SysAdmin** (Oct ‘98 – Nov ‘98)

Responsible for system maintenance, new system deployment, archive management, and NIS account management, in a large, heterogeneous (Solaris, HP/UX, AIX and Linux) development environment. I was the primary liaison between the Cambridge office and our Sun and HP reps; helped negotiate better leasing terms for our high-end development and benchmarking systems. I also managed the summer internship program, overseeing 3 interns on various projects, including a Red Hat Kickstart system for fully automating the installation and configuration of Linux systems running Oracle 8i (which enabled rapid deployment of inexpensive testbeds for our development and QA teams).

**NT SysAdmin** (Oct ‘97 – Oct ‘98)

As an NT Admin, I was initially responsible for first-level desktop support. After becoming an MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional), I assumed file-, email-, print- and domain-server administration responsibilities; managed our network-based anti-virus solution (Sophos), automated desktop application deployment system (Office installation scripts), local subnet ip addresses, NT user accounts and privileges; deployed a system imaging process automating desktop installation, setup, and configuration (Symantec Ghost).
